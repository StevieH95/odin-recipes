    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This authentic Indian lamb curry is made with lamb shoulder. It’s simmered with fragrant spices, caramelized onions, and Greek yogurt until fork-tender. Served over Indian bread or basmati rice, this is a meal on its own.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lamb</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Garlic and ginger</li>
            <li>Yogurt</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            <li>Spice mix</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven or heavy bottom skillet, add the oil, ghee, and whole spices</li>
            <li>Then, add onions and saute until caramelized, almost brown – about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next, add the ginger and garlic – saute for another minute. Add the lamb pieces, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until the lamb is no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Then, add the ground spices and chopped tomatoes. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes until fragrant</li>
            <li>Next, add the yogurt. Combine it then add 1/2 cup of water. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Continue to simmer on the stovetop on medium-low heat, stirring frequently until meat is cooked through and becomes fork-tender – about 1 to 1 ½ hour adding water if necessary.
            <li>Pro tip – Always ensure you have enough water so the meat has enough moisture to cook. If necessary add ¼ to ½ cup more.</li>
            <li>When cooked to fork-tender, taste and adjust seasoning. Adjust gravy by adding a bit more water depending on how you going to serve it</li>    
            <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley.</li> 
        </ol>
